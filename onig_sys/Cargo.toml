description = """
The `onig_sys` crate contains raw rust bindings to the
oniguruma library. This crate exposes a set of unsafe
functions which can then be used by other crates to
create safe wrappers around Oniguruma.

You probably don't want to link to this crate directly;
instead check out the `onig` crate.
